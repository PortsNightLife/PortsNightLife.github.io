    <h1>Mission statement</h1>
    <p>Ports.NightLife (Ports = Portsmouth) has designed an easy to use app for Android and iOS that providing unique information and tickets about clubbing in Portsmouth. The idea behind the app is to give students more of an idea of what experiences different
      clubs have to offer and to generally make clubbing a cheaper and more pleasant experience for students in Portsmouth. Ports.NightLife has reinvented the traditional queue by providing a live feed of how long club queues make a huge effort to create
      an enjoyable place where customers can socialise willn beach other in a comfortable and relaxing environment while enjoying the best made coffee and traditional English breakfasts in Sutton. We will be helping our customers to relieve stress by
      providing peace of mind through having a convenient location, friendly customer service and products of high quality.Another aspect that I want to achieve for my café is I hope that different branches open up around London stations, making us a
      credible local brand. I also wish to authorize an image for our café around London, making my business far more detectable. I wish for my café to become more wide reaching and enabling more customers to access it, this will help keep building an
      image and sometimes you gain customers simply for your image. I also wish to improve the country economy by employing people.
