    <h1>Nightclubs and collaboration with them </h1>
    <p>The main nightclubs in Portsmouth we ideally want to collaborate with our app Ports.NightLife is: The Astoria Lyberry PopWorld Pryzm TigerTiger Nightclubs that collbarate will likely receive commission on ticket sales and free advertising via having
      their nightclub on our app and of course more people in their Nightclub leading to higher revenues for them offering an exciting prospect for clubs in partnership with the app.
